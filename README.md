# Catalyst Evaluation Reports Portal

A professional web portal for hosting and viewing psychological evaluation reports generated by the Catalyst Evaluator v1.8 system.

## 🌐 Live Portal

Once deployed, your portal will be available at:
```
https://catalyst-eval.github.io/evaluation_generator/
```

## 🚀 Quick Setup

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository settings: https://github.com/catalyst-eval/evaluation_generator/settings
2. Scroll down to "Pages" section
3. Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
4. Choose "main" (or "master") branch
5. Select "/ (root)" as the folder
6. Click "Save"

### Step 2: Upload Files

1. **Rename the index file:**
   - Rename `github_pages_index.html` to `index.html`
   - Upload to the root of your repository

2. **Create folder structure (optional but recommended):**
   ```
   evaluation_generator/
   ├── index.html           # Portal homepage
   ├── reports/            # Directory for evaluation reports
   │   ├── BS_2025_09_18_1313_Neurodiversity_Screener.html
   │   ├── NTS_2025_09_15_1709_Neurodiversity_Screener.html
   │   └── ... (more reports)
   └── .github/
       └── workflows/
           └── deploy.yml   # GitHub Actions workflow
   ```

3. **Upload evaluation reports:**
   - Upload HTML reports either to root or `/reports` directory
   - Use consistent naming: `ClientID_YYYY_MM_DD_HHMM_BatteryType.html`

### Step 3: Deploy with GitHub Actions (Optional)

1. Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` in your repository
2. Copy the contents from `.github_workflows_deploy.yml`
3. Commit and push - the action will run automatically

## 📁 File Naming Convention

For automatic parsing and display, name your report files as:
```
ClientID_YYYY_MM_DD_HHMM_BatteryType.html
```

Examples:
- `BS_2025_09_18_1313_Neurodiversity_Screener.html`
- `JD_2025_09_19_0930_Trauma_Battery.html`
- `ABC_2025_09_20_1445_Comprehensive_Assessment.html`

## 🔧 Features

- **Professional Dashboard**: Statistics and overview of all reports
- **Search & Filter**: Find reports by client ID, date, or battery type
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Privacy-Focused**: Uses only initials and timestamps
- **Automatic Updates**: Reports list updates when new files are added
- **GitHub Integration**: Fetches reports directly from repository

## 🎨 Customization

### Changing Colors

Edit the CSS variables in `index.html`:
```css
/* Primary color (Bridge Family Therapy blue) */
background: #367AA6;

/* Hover state */
background: #2c5f8d;
```

### Adding Battery Types

Update the filter options and badge classes:
```javascript
// In the battery filter select
<option value="new-battery">New Battery Name</option>

// Add corresponding badge style
.badge-new-battery {
    background: #your-color;
    color: #text-color;
}
```

### Modifying Report Table Columns

Find the table headers and adjust:
```html
<thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Status</th>
        <th>Client ID</th>
        <th>Date</th>
        <th>Battery Type</th>
        <th class="hide-mobile">Assessments</th>
        <th>Actions</th>
    </tr>
</thead>
```

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

- **No Backend**: All processing happens client-side
- **No Data Storage**: Reports are read directly from GitHub
- **Anonymized IDs**: Only initials and timestamps are displayed
- **HTTPS Only**: GitHub Pages serves all content over HTTPS

## 📝 Adding New Reports

### Manual Upload
1. Generate report using Catalyst Evaluator v1.8
2. Upload the HTML file to your repository
3. The portal will automatically detect and display it

### Via Git Command Line
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/catalyst-eval/evaluation_generator.git

# Add your report file
cp /path/to/report.html reports/

# Commit and push
git add reports/report.html
git commit -m "Add evaluation report for Client XYZ"
git push
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Reports Not Showing Up
- Ensure files are named correctly (see naming convention above)
- Check that files are HTML format
- Wait a few minutes for GitHub Pages to update
- Clear browser cache and refresh

### GitHub API Rate Limiting
- The portal uses GitHub's public API which has rate limits
- If you hit the limit, reports will still be accessible via direct links
- Consider implementing caching or authentication for heavy usage

### Page Not Loading
- Verify GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings
- Check that index.html is in the root directory
- Ensure repository is public (or you're logged in for private repos)
